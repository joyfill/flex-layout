// ComponentEvents — the outbound-event sink handed to each component factory.
//
// Phase 2 added the `propagates` bit on events.
// Phase 3 adds `binding(_:)` — a typed escape hatch that hands the factory a
// SwiftUI `Binding<String>` for a named field (e.g. `"value"`, `"checked"`).
// The surrounding payload decides what backs the binding (`FormState` in
// production, a plain local value in tests/previews); factories remain
// oblivious.
//
// Stub note: the red commit returns `.constant("")` from `binding(_:)`
// unconditionally. The matching green commit will delegate to an injected
// resolver so `FormState` can own the storage.
