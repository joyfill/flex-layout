// ComponentResolver — picks the right view source for every node.
//
// Phase 1 lookup priority:
//   1. `locals[id]`           — inline `Component("id") { … }` overrides
//   2. `registry[schemaType]` — the package-wide component factory table
//   3. `placeholder(id)`      — caller-supplied fallback (default =
//                               `PlaceholderBox` in debug, empty in release)
//
// The resolver returns structured `ResolvedChild` values carrying the
// chosen `Resolution` tag so tests and debug logging can see which branch
// fired without inspecting the opaque SwiftUI view.
